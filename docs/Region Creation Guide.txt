Step 4: Drawing the Borders (The Fun Part)
Now we trace your map image to define the territories.

Go back to MacroMap.tscn.

Instance a Region:

Drag Region.tscn into the scene (under Regions node).

Rename it (e.g., "Region_Norway_South").

Assign Data:

In the Inspector, assign a WorldRegionData resource (e.g., Region_Monastery.tres).

Draw the Clickable Area:

Select the CollisionPolygon2D child of that new region.

In the Toolbar, click the "Create Points" tool (Pencil icon).

Click around the border of that territory on your map image to trace it.

Tip: You don't need pixel-perfect precision; just rough shapes work fine.

Draw the Highlight:

Select the HighlightPoly child.

Crucial Trick: You don't want to draw it twice!

Select your CollisionPolygon2D. In the Inspector, look for Polygon. Click it -> Copy.

Select HighlightPoly. In the Inspector, look for Polygon. Click it -> Paste.

Now your highlight perfectly matches your click area.

Step 5: Repeat
Repeat Step 4 for every territory on your map image.

Duplicate the Region node.

Move/Redraw the CollisionPolygon2D points.

Copy points to HighlightPoly.

Assign new WorldRegionData.
