Devlog: "Defense-First" MVP is Complete!
We've successfully completed our "Defense-First" MVP. The goal was to prove our core "Micro-to-Bridge" loop by building a playable, grid-based defensive battle. We can confirm that all 5 implementation tasks are now functional and integrated.

Here's a breakdown of our progress:

✅ Task 1: Data Foundations Built

We successfully defined our core data structures, BuildingData.gd and UnitData.gd.

This allows us to create new units and buildings (like the "Stone Wall" and "Great Hall") entirely as .tres resource files, with no new code required.

✅ Task 2: Core Grid & Manager Implemented

The SettlementManager singleton is live. It now successfully creates, configures, and manages the AStarGrid2D pathfinding object.

It handles all building placement logic, correctly marking tiles as "solid" on the grid.

✅ Task 3: Test Scene Operational

Our main SettlementBridge.tscn is fully functional as the MVP's "conductor."

It successfully spawns the level, instances the UI, and captures player input to test our building logic.

✅ Task 4: Reactive AI & Pathfinding Complete

We have a working BaseUnit with a Finite State Machine (FSM) that correctly manages IDLE, MOVE, and ATTACK states.

The AI successfully requests paths from the SettlementManager.

Crucially, the AI is now reactive. Thanks to our EventBus integration, units listening for the pathfinding_grid_updated signal will automatically re-calculate their path when the player builds a new wall.

✅ Task 5: Full "Sacked" Loop Complete!

This is the final win that connects everything. The SettlementBridge now:

Spawns the Great Hall.

Spawns a Raider and tells it to attack the Hall.

The Raider paths to a walkable tile above the Hall (solving our "stuck" bug).

It successfully enters the ATTACK state and deals damage until the Hall is destroyed.

The Hall's building_destroyed signal is caught, triggering the "YOU HAVE BEEN SACKED" UI state and ending the combat.

⚠️ Key Challenges & Amendments
A core part of this MVP was "retiring risk," and we solved several major technical hurdles:

GDD Amendment (StaticBody2D): We proved the GDD's Area2D spec for buildings was incorrect for our goals. We've amended the GDD to use StaticBody2D, which correctly provides the physical collision needed for pathfinding.

AI Range & "Jank": We fixed a bug where the AI's "attack range" was too short, causing it to "re-engage" and get stuck. By increasing the range in the Unit_Raider.tres file, we've confirmed the AI can now complete its attack cycle.

Singleton vs. class_name: We debugged and resolved the core engine conflict between Autoload singletons (like EventBus and SettlementManager) and custom resource scripts (like BuildingData).

In short: The foundation is built and it is solid.

This officially concludes our work on the MVP implementation plan. We are now ready to move on to the post-MVP roadmap.
