Devlog Update: Pivoting to a More Robust Economic Loop

This week saw a major refinement to our core economic loop. After prototyping an initial time-based system, we made a key strategic decision to pivot to a simpler, more predictable, and more balanced fixed-payout model. This new system feels more satisfying for the player and provides a much stronger foundation for future development.

Key Insight: From Time-Based to Action-Based Rewards
*   Initial Prototype: We successfully implemented a full, time-based resource generation system. This prototype was crucial for testing our data persistence and UI flow.
*   Design Realization: Through testing, we identified that time-based rewards, while realistic, could feel unpredictable and create balancing challenges. It also less directly rewarded the player's core action of completing an attack.
*   ðŸ’¡ The Pivot (Design Choice): We made the call to switch to a fixed-payout system. This decision ties the reward directly to the gameplay loop: one attack equals one payout. This model is more "gamey," respects the player's effort, and gives them a clear understanding of the value of their economic buildings.

Core Achievements & Current Features

*   âœ… Rock-Solid Persistence
*   Player purchases of economic buildings like the Lumber Yard are saved instantly and permanently to a .tres resource file. What you build stays built.

*   âœ… Predictable, Fixed Payouts
*   A new fixedpayoutamount property has been added to all economic buildings.
*   Returning to the settlement after an attack now triggers a clean calculate_payout() function.

*   âœ… Simple & Scalable Logic
*   The payout is now a simple sum of the fixedpayoutamount from all owned economic buildings.
*   Example: Owning two Lumber Yards (at 10 Wood each) results in a guaranteed "Wood: 20" payout after every attack.

*   âœ… Full UI Integration
*   The "Welcome Home" popup correctly displays the calculated fixed payout.
*   The "Collect" button works perfectly, transferring the generated resources to the player's main treasury and updating the UI.

*   âœ… Streamlined & Cleaned Codebase
*   As a result of the pivot, the entire economic codebase has been simplified.
*   All complex timestamp-tracking logic, variables, and debug functions have been completely removed, making the system much easier to maintain and expand upon.
